function [mapL,mapR,hPatchesL,hPatchesR,params2] = PlotInterpSurfMesh(volume, meshL, meshR, dim, params)

% PLOTINTERPSURFMESH Interpolates volumetric data onto hemispheric meshes for
% display.
%
%   PLOTINTERPSURFMESH(volume, meshL, meshR, dim) takes functional imaging
%   data "volume" and interpolates it onto the left and right hemispheric
%   surface meshes given in "meshL" and "meshR", respectively, using the
%   spatial information in "dim". The result is a bilateral sagittal view
%   of the activations overlain onto the surface of the brain represented
%   by the meshes.
%
%   PLOTINTERPSURFMESH(volume, meshL, meshR, dim, params) allows the user to
%   specify parameters for plot creation.
%
%   "params" fields that apply to this function (and their defaults):
%       Scale       (90% max)       Maximum value to which image is scaled.
%       Th                          Thresholds.
%           .P      (25% max)       Value of min threshold to display
%                                   positive data values.
%           .N      (-Th.P)         Value of max threshold to display
%                                   negative data values.
