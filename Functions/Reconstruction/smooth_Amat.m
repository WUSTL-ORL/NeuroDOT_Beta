function iA_out = smooth_Amat(iA_in, dim, gsigma)

% SMOOTH_AMAT Performs Gaussian smoothing on a sensitivity matrix.
%
%   iA_out = SMOOTH_AMAT(iA_in, dim, gsigma) takes the inverted VOX x MEAS
%   sensitivity matrix "iA_in" and performs Gaussian smoothing in the 3D
%   voxel space on each of the concatenated measurement matrices within,
%   returning it as "iA_out". The user specifies the Gaussian filter
%   half-width "gsigma".
