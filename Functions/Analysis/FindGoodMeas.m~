function info_out = FindGoodMeas(data, info_in, bthresh)

% FINDGOODMEAS Performs "Good Measurements" analysis.
%
%   info_out = FINDGOODMEAS(data, info_in) takes a light-level array "data"
%   in the MEAS x TIME format, and calculates the std of each channel
%   as its noise level. These are then thresholded by the default value of
%   0.075 to create a logical array, and both are returned as MEAS x 1
%   columns of the "info.MEAS" table. If pulse synch point information
%   exists in "info.system.synchpts", then FINDGOODMEAS will crop the data
%   to the start and stop pulses.
%
%   info_out = FINDGOODMEAS(data, info_in, bthresh) allows the user to
%   specify a threshold value.
