function [BA_out,BSTD_out,BT_out,blocks] = BlockAverage(data_in, pulse, dt,Tkeep)

% BLOCKAVERAGE Averages data by stimulus blocks.
%
%   data_out = BLOCKAVERAGE(data_in, pulse, dt) takes a data array
%   "data_in" and uses the pulse and dt information to cut that data 
%   timewise into blocks of equal length (dt), which are then averaged 
%   together and output as "data_out".
% 
%   Tkeep is a temporal mask. Any time points with a zero in this vector is
%   set to NaN.
